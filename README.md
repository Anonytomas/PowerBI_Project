# What is this?

This project was completed while following a YouTube series from Alex the Analyst https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0m5sEHPU-s&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8HqnmK0gQhfmIdCbxwoAoys.
The series covers everything from installing PowerBI, transforming data, conditional formatting, visualizations, and more. The lessons contain the completed PowerBI files from following the content.
The project folder contains the completed project in PowerBI and relevant data. The project data is based on a real survey of participants who work with data in their jobs.

# How I worked on this project

* I installed PowerBI on my home machine.
* I transformed data to better fit visualization needs.
* I worked with real and mock datasets to create realistic visualizations.
* I manipulated the cardinality of tables to ensure compatibility of data via primary keys.

# Why I chose this project

* My goal was to learn more about PowerBI and get hands-on experience.
* I decided a YouTube crash course with applicable data that I could use would be best for learning.
* I found that many job postings want applications with PowerBI experience.

# How I would improve this visualization further

* I would continue to clean the data from the project folder by transforming it.
* I would elaborate on 'other' categories to group more partipants with custom field entries into relevant positions.
* Finally, I would use the refined data to create more critical visualizations in a clean format.
